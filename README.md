## xmas lights

### What?

A project to build and control a set of Christmas tree lights.
Each light an individually addressable RGB LED. The lights are 
on the local wifi. So any wifi connected device can send a 
pattern of colours to the lights. 
If The lights are scattered on a Christmas tree. Then we need 
to determine the spatial co-ordinates of the lights in order 
to make spatially sensible patterns.


### Why?

### How?

* Build the hardware.
  *   [Circuit descriptin](./arduino/wiring/README.md)
* Program the micro-controller
* Program a controller
  * Set colour pattern
  * Derive the light positions
  * Set a spatial pattern
